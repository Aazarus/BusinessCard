📇 My Business Card

This is a simple React app that displays my business card on one page. It includes a picture of me at the top, along with my name, job title, email address, and LinkedIn profile. There is also an "About Me" section where I can write a brief summary of my experience and skills, as well as an "Interests" section where I can list some of my hobbies and interests.
